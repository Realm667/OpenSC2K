# Quality of life

The interface uses shared dialog margins, control spacing, headings and keyboard
focus styles in both themes. Utility windows follow theme changes immediately.

The dark theme follows the Reticulating Splines website: anthracite surfaces,
dark inset controls, lime selection/focus markers and primary actions, and petrol
secondary actions. Montserrat uses the existing Korean fallback; its OFL license
is included in exports and the About licenses. Dark is the default for new or
invalid preferences; an explicitly saved light theme is retained. The Bright
variant uses the same typography and components with pale surfaces, dark text,
and lime/petrol accents. Saved transparency preferences remain available.
The centered startup logo and existing progress system share the dark palette;
percentage text changes color at the fill edge. Window panels paint their entire
rectangular surface, avoiding black corner gaps. Selecting a theme does not alter
cities or simulation state.

Floating windows use an elevation shadow over the city. Multiplayer chat uses
the same Montserrat family as the rest of the interface. Long tooltips wrap at
word boundaries to about 55 average characters per line, measured with the active
font and limited by the window width.

Start New City uses the neutral button style. Headings use bold Montserrat.
The in-game Multiplayer menu is disabled outside a session; the main-menu entry
still opens hosting/joining. About identifies Reticulating Splines, its features,
project link, upstream OpenSC2K attribution, dependencies and original-asset
rights. Project text, credits navigation and update status translate live;
third-party license documents retain their original wording.

## Tool flyouts

Tool groups use a compact three-column sidebar. Click a group to select its last
used tool. Hold the button for 450 ms to open the available subtools beside the
sidebar. Groups with only one offered tool select it directly.
The group button keeps its category icon; the menu retains names, prices,
availability and a marked selection. Toolbar icons use a cool gray background
(#717479). Subtool previews retain all Large-set source pixels, independently of
map zoom, and scale only their displayed footprint. The smaller layer controls
stay at the bottom of the sidebar. The sidebar does not expand for subtools.
The three zoom/navigation buttons together match the width of the tool grid.

Choose an entry with the mouse, or use the arrow keys and Enter. Selection,
Escape or an outside click closes the menu. The outside click is consumed so
it cannot also build on the map. Long lists scroll, and menus fit inside the
current viewport. Resizing the view, hiding the sidebar or entering the terrain
editor closes the menu. Existing keyboard shortcuts and the middle-button picker
select tools without forcing a menu open. Tool selection memory follows the
existing city session; this feature does not add saved workspace layouts.

## Pick an existing tool

Click an existing building or network with the middle mouse button to select
its building tool. Developed residential, commercial and industrial buildings
select their zone and density. Underground view picks pipes or subway tools.
Unavailable inventions and rewards remain unavailable. A middle-button drag
still pans the map. The action can be rebound in Settings → Controls.

## Window positions

In-game windows remember their positions and resizable dimensions locally.
Positions outside the current screen are brought back into view. Opening a new
city does not reopen a budget decision or other modal prompt.

## Music box

Options → Music box distinguishes **SC2000 original music**, **Reticulating
Splines**, other selected replacement packs, and personal music folders. Original music
requires a loaded imported SC2000 data pack and available imported music files.
The sibling music pack from that import remains selectable when a replacement
pack is selected for automatic music. Installed `packs/standalone-audio/music`
and the selected music pack are also checked. Missing sources are not offered.
Manual choices use the exact source file and the selected SoundFont; they never
fall through to another pack with the same numeric slot.
Choose a source or personal folder on the left, then double-click a title on the
right. The current song has a play marker; tooltips show its source and file path.
The Favorites tab stores an ordered collection across restarts. Select a track and
use Add to favorites; duplicates are ignored and a star marks favorites in Tracks.
Remove and Move up edit the saved collection. Double-click a favorite or press
Play / Pause in Favorites to play that collection. Playback stays within Favorites
even while browsing another tab or folder; missing entries are retained but skipped.
An empty Favorites collection never falls through to all tracks. Previous, Play / Pause and
Next also work through the configured media keys while the music box is active.
Automatic music returns to the original game selection. Closing the window keeps
the current playback. Disabling Music in Options stops custom playback.

Music changes fade briefly. The music-box volume controls the audible output
without changing the original controller's music activity or simulation timing.
The effects slider changes the existing effects preference. Only imported original music
uses the soundtrack titles from *SIM-MELODY from SIM CITY2000*, matched to
Windows MIDI resource IDs (10000–10018), independently of installed file names.
These proper names remain unchanged across interface languages. Replacement and
personal MP3s use the ID3 song title, falling back to their filename. The shipped
legacy "Standalone Music" pack is labeled Reticulating Splines; replacement files
are never assigned SC2000 soundtrack titles. Source labels also appear during
automatic playback, whose selection and timing remain unchanged. The [title-to-MIDI reference](https://w.atwiki.jp/gamemusicbest100/pages/2869.html)
lists both the game cue names and the soundtrack titles used here. In particular,
10016 is “The Construction: HAPPYLAND”; the album order differs from MIDI order.

Window layouts and music preferences live beside the local settings file in
`.layouts.cfg` and `.music-box.cfg` files. They are not stored in cities. Favorites
persist; the old queue is merged into favorites once without duplicates. Legacy
queue, named lists and workspace sections are retained
as inactive data, with no load/save UI; custom playback does not start automatically at launch.
Music and effects have separate volume sliders. Progress and elapsed/total time
are shown for decoded recordings. MIDI playback has no recorded duration and
shows a dash instead of a fabricated time. The progress bar does not seek.

The bounded read-only metadata reader supports ID3v1 and ID3v2.2/2.3/2.4 title
frames, including Latin-1, UTF-8 and UTF-16. It reads at most 1 MiB of tag data and
keeps up to 512 title characters. Unsupported, empty or corrupt tags fall back
to the filename. Song identity remains the source/path, even for duplicate titles.

### Add your own MP3 music

1. Open **Options → Music box → Open music folder**. This creates and opens the
   `music` folder in the game's user data directory. In a portable installation
   it is `data/music` beside the executable.
2. Create your own subfolders, for example `music/Evening`, and put MP3 files
   inside them. Nested folders and MP3 files directly in `music` also work.
3. Select **Rescan**, or reopen the music box. Choose a folder on the left,
   then double-click a track to play it.

Each real subfolder appears as a collection, including empty folders. Its label
uses the ID3 album name (TALB/TAL or ID3v1) when tagged tracks agree on one album;
missing tags do not override that name. Mixed albums, untagged and empty folders
use the folder name. Tooltips retain the folder path and full album name. IDs and
favorites still use relative paths, so changing a tag does not change playback.
The root
music folder appears when it contains MP3s directly. In the Tracks tab,
playback continues through the visible collection. Original and personal tracks
can share the Favorites collection. ID3 titles or fallback filenames are displayed;
files are read in place and are never copied, renamed or modified.

Personal tracks use paths relative to `music` so favorites survive moving the
whole user data directory. Renaming a song or folder requires adding it to the
favorites again. Removed files remain in saved favorites and are skipped by Next
and automatic progression. An unreadable MP3 returns playback to automatic game
music with a notice. Folder links are not followed. No pack manifest, original
resource number, restart or external audio converter is required for MP3s.

New interface strings are in the central language catalogs and `messages.pot`.
Language availability follows the application's registered language set. No
original game assets are included in this feature.

## City and terrain previews

The city file chooser shows a whole-city preview for the selected file and reuses
it while loading. Extended SC2X saves can embed a thumbnail; older files use an
isolated rendering job and a bounded local cache. Browsing does not modify the
city or advance its simulation. See [preview storage](sc2x-format.md#optional-city-preview).

New City prepares terrain and overview artwork in a worker, with progress feedback
while the interface remains responsive. Preview images and seasonal masks are
bounded to the display size, including on 4096-tile maps. The overview uses muted
greens and cool water colors. Supported visual settings are applied before the
preview appears, avoiding a flash of unenhanced terrain. This overview does not
replace the full visual environment of a founded, playable city.

## Manual save backups

Overwriting a single-player city keeps its previous valid file beside it as
`<filename>.bak`, for example `My City.sc2x.bak`. Each successful backup replaces
the older backup with the immediate predecessor. The first save creates no backup.
The backup is staged and verified before the city is overwritten. If it cannot
be created, saving stops and the current file remains unchanged. An already invalid
city file does not replace an existing valid backup.

This applies to manual Save, Save As over an existing file, and saving before
leaving a city. Autosaves retain their existing separate retention policy;
multiplayer keeps its existing session backup behavior. To recover a backup,
copy it to a new filename with the original `.sc2`, `.scn`, or `.sc2x` extension
and open that copy.
